# alpine-extras

Docker "Alpine" image with a few extras added:

1. bash
2. git
3. jq

## Source

Find the Dockerfile and Makefile on [github](https://github.com/ranger6/alpine-extras)

## Tags and Releases

There are no "latest" versions pushed to public repositories.

Releases are not worth the effort: the pushed image is tagged with the tag of the Alpine base image used in the build.
